    <h3>She is best teacher I could ever hope for.She encourages and when I don't want to do it or couldn't do it
        because maybe I was too lazy instead of giving me a lecture ("and I think of lectures as scoldings") she just
        asks to try to finish it this time before the next class.Really (and Im not bragging or
        anything)from all the hope she gives I try to respond any child will response it is such.</h3>
